# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation
### Hello There,Mohammad Elkhiat
----
In this project we will work on bitwise operation (manipulation).

#### AS usual we will create the README.md -this file- and the header file (main.h) first then see what are the tasks. ####

The tasks are

### 0. 0
_mandatory_
Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

- Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);
- where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars
- Return: the converted number, or 0 if
					- there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1
					- b is NULL
_Its file_ - 0-binary_to_uint.c
