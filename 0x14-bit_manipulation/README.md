# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation
### Hello There,Mohammad Elkhiat
In this project we will work on bitwise operation (manipulation).
---
#### AS usual we will create the README.md -this file- and the header file (main.h) first then see what are the tasks. ####
---
The tasks are

### 0. 0
- mandatory
- Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

- Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);
- where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars
- Return: the converted number, or 0 if
					there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1
					b is NULL
Its file - 0-binary_to_uint.

### 1. 1
- mandatory
- Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

- Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);
- Format: see example
- You are not allowed to use arrays
- You are not allowed to use malloc
- You are not allowed to use the % or / operatorsc
Its file - 1-print_binary.c
